I do not charge extra for this, but it will add some time to your total turnaround.  Usually it takes 1 extra week, but it can be longer during busy times. Changes to fonts and colors are easy and typically do not require extra design time.\n\nCAN YOU MAKE A DESIGN WITH A LICENSED CHARACTER (SNOOPY, STAR WARS, HELLO KITTY, ETC.)?\nI do NOT use any designs that violate US Copyright or Trademark law. I cannot create designs with licensed characters (Star Wars, Snoopy, Hello Kitty, etc.).\n\nCAN YOU GIFT WRAP?  DO YOU PUT PRICES ON YOUR PACKING SLIPS?\nI do not gift wrap items, but I am always happy to include a gift note upon request.  We NEVER include prices on our packing slips because so many purchases are sent directly to gift recipients.\n\nHOW DO I GET MY PERSONALIZATION OR PARTY INFORMATION TO YOU?\nThere is a &quot;NOTES&quot; section at checkout. Please leave all of your wording there, along with any special requests. If you need a photo added to an invitation, please send that to us by etsy message.\n\nI ORDERED A DIY EDITABLE ITEM. HOW DO I EDIT IT?\n1. Download your file from etsy (GO TO you&gt;purchases & reviews)\n\n2. Download the LATEST version of Adobe Reader. FREE at get.adobe.com\/reader.  You MUST have the newest version for the fonts to work.\n\n3. Open Reader. Hit file&gt;open & select the PDF.\n\n4. Type your text.  Don&#39;t cut & paste- that can mess up the fonts.\n\n5. To change font size, open the properties panel: control-E (PC) or command-E (Mac). You can change size, fonts, colors & spacing.\n\n6. Save your item under a new name. (TIP:  If it won&#39;t let you save, you are either using an old version of Reader or your Mac accidentally opened it in Preview.\n\n7. Print using Adobe Reader, or send to a local print center. (Just make sure they open it in Reader to print.)\n\nHOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET MY ITEM?\nIf you ask for a proof, it all depends on how quickly you reply to the proof email.  Some clients reply in 10 minutes, and some take 2 weeks. If you take longer to reply, it will take longer for your finished item to get to you.\n\nAfter you approve your proof, typical production times are:\n\n* Invitations & Paper Goods - about 3 business days, with shipping by USPS or FedEX Ground\n\n*iPhone Cases - about 3 business days, with shipping by USPS first class mail\n\n* Mugs - about 3 business days, with shipping by USPS Priority 2-Day Mail.\n\n* Clipboards, Plates, Platters and Tote Bags - approximately a week to produce, but we try to speed this up when possible.\n\n* Stamps - 1-2 business days, with shipping by USPS first class mail.\n\nYIKES!  I PROCRASTINATED AND NEED MY INVITATIONS ASAP! CAN YOU HELP?\nWe understand that invitations are often a rush order.  We don&#39;t judge, because we realize how hectic Mom Life can be.  :)  \n\nFor standard invitation orders, we send a proof about one business day after you order. Once you approve the proof, you typically have your invitations delivered in about a week (plus or minus a day or two).\n\nIf you are in a RUSH, we can definitely help. We can rush the order and bump you up to overnight shipping, but this costs a bit extra. Please contact us for an exact quote, but the average rush fee is $15 or $20 and you have your invitations in hand about 2 days after you approve the proof.\n\n(For rush orders, we have a minimum quantity of 20 invitations.)","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1400182477,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SwankyPress?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/5252463\/iusb_760x100.13096416_3pmq.jpg","num_favorers":4755,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/5252463\/isla_fullxfull.19125078_cimam7r8.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":252091964,"state":"active","user_id":62946635,"category_id":69150425,"title":"I&#39;m Not Always a Bitch Coffee Mug - Mature - Adult Humor - Funny Mug - Girlfriends - Women - BFF - Glitter Mug - Personalized - Bitch Mug","description":"We all know that one person who we instantly think of when we see a mug like this!

The beauty and richness of the wood stands out in this 3\/4&quot; thick oriented strand bamboo table top.  The turned solid hardwood legs taper down fashionably to the satin nickel feet with bumpers underneath to keep your floors safe.  The edges are beveled for safety and aesthetic.\n\nThe table top is 32&quot; long and is 18&quot; wide making it the perfect size for a medium sized coffee table that won&#39;t take up all your space.  Height is 16&quot; Tall.

You will surprised at how luxurious it is too, very aesthetically delightful combination. It is rustic..but there is this pearly glow that floats on the surface that gives this cup a depth that can only be appreciated in person. It fits perfectly in the palm of my hand, and there is a little lip on the rim that makes drinking from it quite enjoyable. Also...tiny little ridges along the inside of that rim give a texture to the touch of the lips...While it may sound odd, I honestly never knew so many of my senses could be awakened from a simple coffee cup.

This type of glaze is used for decorating the pottery and also for creating a surface that protects the pottery from water.

They make the perfect couples gift, anniversary gift, wedding gift, bridal shower gift, engagement gift, his and her gift, or just an I love you gift! You will receive a set of 2 coffee mugs.\n\nThese are NOT Dollar Store coffee mugs. They are beautiful, high quality porcelain mugs (not ceramic). The mugs themselves are white, 4 inches tall, and hold 12 oz.  Mr & Mrs are in black, with the last name in the color and font of your choice. As you will see in the listing photos, you can choose from a Fancy Script Font and a Casual Type Font. \n\nThe mugs are personalized with a high quality permanent vinyl, which will not come off. However, in order to keep the quality high, please hand wash them just to be safe. Not dishwasher or microwave safe.\n\n--Please select the color and font for the last name for each mug from the drop down menu. If there is a color you would like that is not listed, please message me to see if I have it. If I have your requested color in stock, I&#39;m happy to use it. If you would like the last names different colors from one another please include that in notes to seller. Otherwise both mugs will have the same color last name. \n\n--Please include the last name you would like it personalized with, in the notes to seller section when you check out. If you are adding a wedding date, include that as well. \n\n--I&#39;m happy to make a Mr. & Mr. or Mrs. & Mrs. Mug by request. Just include that info in notes to seller.\n\n--Mugs are for right handed use by default. However, please include a note that you need one or both mugs left handed, and I&#39;ll customize the reverse side for left handed use.\n\nThese are porcelain mugs, and are fragile.

Because this is a genuine Starbucks Reusable Cup you get 10 cents off at Starbucks each time you use it! BAM! \n\nDomestic shipping by Priority \u2605 Mail \u2605 | Canadian shipping by USPS First Class\nAll shipping is discounted on 2 or more items.\n\nHand washing recommended for long lasting enjoyment.\n\n*This is a Genuine Starbucks\u00ae Reusable Cup sold in Starbucks Stores.  You are receiving the cup free and paying for my time and the personalize portion of the cup.\n\nLike my page and become a fan on Facebook!\nwww.facebook.com\/CleverHollyDesigns","creation_tsz":1466701957,"ending_tsz":1477242757,"original_creation_tsz":1452217545,"last_modified_tsz":1466701957,"price":"9.95","currency_code":"USD","quantity":34,"tags":["coffee cup","travel mug","gift idea","Starbucks coffee cup","This Might Be Wine","wine gift","coffee gift","this might be","Starbucks Funny","fun wine gift","funny wine gift","This Might Be Rum","This Might Be Vodka"],"category_path":["Housewares"],"category_path_ids":[69150425],"materials":["coffee cup","travel mug","coffee mug","starbucks coffee cup","tea cup","Priority Mail","Size 16 oz","Sense of Humor","washable vinyl"],"shop_section_id":17804249,"featured_rank":3,"state_tsz":1462130988,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/263076876\/starbucks-coffee-this-might-be-wine-or?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":3387,"num_favorers":290,"shipping_template_id":22181248863,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1862,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Kitchen & Dining","Drink & Barware","Drinkware"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":899458391,"hex_code":"68685D","red":104,"green":104,"blue":93,"hue":60,"saturation":10,"brightness":40,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452220250,"listing_id":263076876,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/136\/0\/10813193\/il_75x75.899458391_p0fe.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/136\/0\/10813193\/il_170x135.899458391_p0fe.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/136\/0\/10813193\/il_570xN.899458391_p0fe.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/136\/0\/10813193\/il_fullxfull.899458391_p0fe.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":907219411,"hex_code":"787267","red":120,"green":114,"blue":103,"hue":39,"saturation":14,"brightness":47,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1453341021,"listing_id":263076876,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/126\/1\/10813193\/il_75x75.907219411_bdfh.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/126\/1\/10813193\/il_170x135.907219411_bdfh.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/126\/1\/10813193\/il_570xN.907219411_bdfh.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/126\/1\/10813193\/il_fullxfull.907219411_bdfh.jpg","full_height":916,"full_width":1125},{"listing_image_id":902189354,"hex_code":"777467","red":119,"green":116,"blue":103,"hue":49,"saturation":13,"brightness":46,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452607645,"listing_id":263076876,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/1\/10813193\/il_75x75.902189354_hxjn.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/1\/10813193\/il_170x135.902189354_hxjn.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/1\/10813193\/il_570xN.902189354_hxjn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/1\/10813193\/il_fullxfull.902189354_hxjn.jpg","full_height":898,"full_width":1398},{"listing_image_id":870007812,"hex_code":"928C79","red":146,"green":140,"blue":121,"hue":46,"saturation":17,"brightness":57,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452217545,"listing_id":263076876,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/127\/1\/10813193\/il_75x75.870007812_6dhd.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/127\/1\/10813193\/il_170x135.870007812_6dhd.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/127\/1\/10813193\/il_570xN.870007812_6dhd.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/127\/1\/10813193\/il_fullxfull.870007812_6dhd.jpg","full_height":1419,"full_width":1188}],"Shop":{"shop_id":10813193,"shop_name":"CleverHollyDesigns","user_id":62754796,"creation_tsz":1440369676,"title":"Quality items for all your handmade gifting needs \ud83d\udc95","announcement":"Clever Holly Designs, where you&#39;ll find ideas from bridesmaid gifts to adorable onesies to personalized cups and tumblers and more...

Through the ages the region has gathered different types of ceramics of Thracians, Romans, Slavs and Proto-Bulgarians. The proximity to the Mediterranean and its rich and diverse culture has influenced the development of Bulgarian crafts.\nIn DankoHandmade we embrace tradition by interpreting it in a modern way. Each of our product lines has its own style and character, but all of them carry the comfort and warmth of Bulgarian land.\n\nThe Process:\n(Explore our shop for other stages of ceramics making)\n\nGLAZING\nAfter the bisque firing the glazing process can begin. The glaze, a mixture of ground glass, clays, coloring materials and water, is applied to the bisque pot by dipping, pouring, spraying, brushing, sponging, or some combination of these techniques. The footring of each piece must be free of glaze and the pot placed to a bisque fired &#39;cookie&#39; made from a stoneware clay body.
